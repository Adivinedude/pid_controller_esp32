Step 1) setup for pid calibration. set status display, reset pid values
Step 2) setpoint temp+1; save temp; turn heat on.
Step 3) target reached. measure peak temp.
Step 4) calculate P(max temp difference / time). 
Step 5) reset time. setpoint = temp+1 wait for temp to peak. (target should not be reached.)
Step 6) calculate i( (setpoint - temp) / time to peak ). temp+1. reset PID. reach target. (target should be overshot)
Step 7) calculate d( Ki ). reset time. measure peak
Step 8) temp+10




calibrations
step 1)
cycle_count / (value 1 - value 0) = p
d = cycle_count required to reach peak

Step 2)
set current temp + 10% to setpoint
start i at .01;

Step 3)
ki divided by time between start of step 2 and now
setpoint = current temp
reset then wait for temp to stablize

Fine Tune:

To Speed up:
    increase i by x% to speed up
    increase d by x% to lower occilations
